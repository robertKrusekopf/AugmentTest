## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Unit Testing
```bash
cd kegelmanager/backend
python test_player_development.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Age curve table showing development factors
- Talent system table showing max potentials
- Club quality bonus table
- Complete development examples
- Real player development (if database exists)

### 2. Integration Testing

**Steps:**
1. Load your existing database
2. Note current player strengths (pick 5-10 players of different ages)
3. Complete all matches in the current season
4. Click "Saisonwechsel" button
5. Check console output for development statistics
6. Verify player strengths have changed appropriately

**Expected Results:**
- Young players (16-23): Should improve
- Peak players (24-27): Minimal change
- Old players (28+): Should decline
- Console shows development summary

### 3. Configuration Testing

**Test 1: Disable Development**
```json
{
  "player_generation": {
    "development": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```
- Run season transition
- Verify no development occurs

**Test 2: Adjust Parameters**
```json
{
  "player_generation": {
    "development": {
      "max_potential_multiplier": 10,  // Higher max potential
      "club_quality_max_bonus": 0.3    // Stronger club effect
    }
  }
}
```
- Run season transition
- Verify changes reflect new parameters

   ```bash
   cd kegelmanager/backend
   python test_player_development.py
   ```

3. **Test on Your Database**

## üìä Expected Behavior

### During Season Transition

**Console Output:**
```
============================================================
PLAYER DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM
============================================================

Development Summary:
  Total players: 1247
  Improved: 523 players (+1456 total strength)
  Declined: 398 players (-892 total strength)
  Unchanged: 326 players

  Biggest improvement: Max M√ºller (Age 19, Talent 9)
    55 ‚Üí 60 (+5)

  Biggest decline: Klaus Weber (Age 35, Talent 6)
    62 ‚Üí 58 (-4)
============================================================
```

### Player Changes

**Young Player (Age 19, Talent 8):**
- Before: Strength 52
- After: Strength 55 (+3)
- All attributes increase proportionally

**Peak Player (Age 26, Talent 6):**
- Before: Strength 48
- After: Strength 48 (0) or 49 (+1)
- Minimal change

**Old Player (Age 33, Talent 5):**
- Before: Strength 45
- After: Strength 43 (-2)
- All attributes decrease proportionally

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No development occurring

**Check:**
1. Is `enabled: true` in config?
2. Are there active (non-retired) players?
3. Check console for error messages

### Issue: Unexpected development amounts

**Check:**
1. Player's age (determines base factor)
2. Player's talent (determines max potential)
3. Current strength vs. max potential
4. Club's training facilities and coaching
5. Randomness factor (¬±15%)

### Issue: Players exceeding 99 strength

**Check:**
1. Clamping logic in `develop_player()`
2. Config min/max attribute values
3. Should not happen - report as bug

### Issue: Season transition fails

**Check:**
1. Error message in console
2. Database connection
3. Player/Club model integrity
4. Try disabling development temporarily
